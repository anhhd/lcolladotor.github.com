## About Fellgernon Bit ([blog](http://bit.ly/FellBit))

Welcome to [Fellgernon Bit](http://bit.ly/FellBit)! It's my _academic_ corner in this bit-world to pretty much share stuff I find interesting. I'll post my comments on news, science in general, Biostatistics, R & Bioconductor, genomics, etc ^_^. All posts appear in [Bmore Biostats](http://bmorebiostat.com/) and the R related ones in [R Bloggers](http://bit.ly/RBloggers).


## About Leo

<img class="image alignleft" src="images/me.png" width="124" height="200" alt="" />

I am a data scientist working with [Andrew Jaffe](http://aejaffe.com/) at the [Lieber Institute for Brain Development](http://www.libd.org/).

As a quick background, I graduated from the [Undergraduate Program on Genomic Sciences](http://www.lcg.unam.mx/) (the [_About_](http://www.lcg.unam.mx/about) page is in English) from the [National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM)](http://unam.mx/) in 2009 and worked for two years at [Winter Genomics](http://wintergenomics.com/aboutus/) analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. I then got a PhD in the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/) thanks to a [CONACyT scholarship](http://www.conacyt.gob.mx/) awarded in 2011. I worked with [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/) and [Andrew Jaffe](http://aejaffe.com/) in developing [derfinder](http://bioconductor.org/packages/derfinder), [regionReport](http://bioconductor.org/packages/regionReport), [recount](http://bioconductor.org/packages/recount) as well as other applied projects.

I am a fan of using [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) and [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/) for data analysis, which I use with [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for creating reproducible reports (hopefully!).
