      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/16347982080/why-statisticians-should-join-and-launch-startups&#34;&gt;Simply Statistics: Why statisticians should join and launch startups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really like this post in &lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com&#34;&gt;SimplyStatistics&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://leekgroup.tumblr.com/&#34;&gt;leekgroup&lt;/a&gt;. The topic is worth considering, but what got me hooked was the list of links to startups, which were all new to me. 100plus looks promising, though I don&amp;#8217;t have a clue as to what they are going to offer. Sure, I know the general topic, but not much beyond that. As I just flew back to town, Flightcaster and Hipmunk caught my attention. While Flightcaster works faster and has a great FAQ, I don&amp;#8217;t find it super useful since it&amp;#8217;s limited to US domestic flights, which are not the kind I usually jump into. Plus, without automatic updates it seems kind of a pain to use. After all, I don&amp;#8217;t want to become a panic-driven person who has to refresh the status of his flight every hour or maybe even every few minutes. Hipmunk on the other hand is slow, but I like their &amp;#8220;agony&amp;#8221; ranking :) It also looks easy to find cheap days to fly though I&amp;#8217;ll mostly cross-check with Expedia when I need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, to read more on the title subject check the original post atÂ &lt;a class=&#34;tumblr_blog&#34; href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/16347982080/why-statisticians-should-join-and-launch-startups&#34;&gt;simplystatistics&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&amp;gt; The tough economic times we live in, and the potential for big paydays, have made &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;entrepreneurship cool&lt;/a&gt;. From the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/startup-america&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;venture capitalist-in-chief&lt;/a&gt;, to the javascript &lt;a href=&#34;http://chats-blog.com/2012/01/08/michael-bloomberg-learning-to-code/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;coding mayor of New York&lt;/a&gt;, everyone is on board. No surprise there, successful startups lead to job creation which can have a&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
