      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m in the process of catching up with all the posts from &lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com&#34;&gt;SimplyStatistics&lt;/a&gt; that I didn&amp;#8217;t read during the break. Doing so I found a very interesting post on p-values (more below)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;tumblr_blog&#34; href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/15402808730/p-values-and-hypothesis-testing-get-a-bad-rap-but-we&#34;&gt;simplystatistics&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post written by Jeff Leek and Rafa Irizarry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value&#34;&gt;p-value&lt;/a&gt; is the most widely-known statistic. P-values are reported in a large majority of scientific publications that measure and report data. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher&#34;&gt;R.A. Fisher&lt;/a&gt; is widely credited with inventing the p-value. If he was cited every time a p-value was reported his paper would have, at the very least, 3 &lt;strong&gt;million&lt;/strong&gt; citations* - making it the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jbc.org/content/280/28/e25.full#&#34;&gt;most highly cited paper&lt;/a&gt; of all time. &lt;/p&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/15402808730/p-values-and-hypothesis-testing-get-a-bad-rap-but-we&#34;&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s like &lt;strong&gt;the p-value is a necessary evil&lt;/strong&gt;. The post is indeed a great read, but what caught my attention was the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;The advent of new measurement technology has shifted much of science from hypothesis driven to discovery driven making the existing multiple testing machinery useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m taking a class with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~crohde/personal/&#34;&gt;Chuck Rohde&lt;/a&gt; on probability with a strong philosophical component. That lead me to ask him recently how he would try to convince a biologist that he should believe/trust statistics. To explain myself a bit more, I asked the question as I&amp;#8217;ve been in environments where people follow their intuition on what is significant or not and disregard whatever statistics says on the same data. So in the past I&amp;#8217;ve been in discussion where I&amp;#8217;m the one trying to convince others that statistics say something is not significantly different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think that I communicated my question correctly as Rohde&amp;#8217;s answer is that whenever he says a +- on count data we (as statisticians) are not doing something right! He also reflected on the past as at some time people were quite into mathematical biology, a field that has either died out or transformed into new fields (systems biology comes to mind). Will the same happen to genomics? *Sound of a coin flipping in the air* I don&amp;#8217;t have a clue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, the post at &lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com&#34;&gt;SimplyStatistics&lt;/a&gt; approaches the same issue I was trying to ask Rohde:&lt;/p&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why not explain to our collaborator that the observation they thought was so convincing can easily happen by chance in a setting that is uninteresting. [&amp;#8230;] In general, we find p-value to be superior to our collaborators intuition of what patterns are statistically interesting and which ones are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end the post, I invite you to read the paper &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18692458&#34;&gt;A Brief History of the Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; by David Glass and Ned Hall from back in 2008. It&amp;#8217;s one of my all time favorites. I&amp;#8217;ve read it a few times and while my memory distorts what they really wrote, in my mind it&amp;#8217;s a great summary with a message: it&amp;#8217;s time to abandon hypothesis-driven science and continue with question-driven science involving building models from data and not from our hypothesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few quotes from their paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;We propose that building hypotheses should be abandoned in favor of posing a straightforward question of a system and then receiving an answer, using that answer to model reality, and then testing the reproducibility and predictive power of the model, modifying it as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They end their paper with:&lt;/p&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, although a hypothesis might have been thought to be necessary in the past, it no longer seems to be so. It is better to see science as a quest for good questions to try to answer, rather than a quest for bold hypotheses to try to refute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you agree?&lt;/p&gt;
