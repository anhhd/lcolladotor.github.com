      <description>&lt;p&gt;John Bohannon wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2012/08/scientists-photos-reveal-their.html&#34;&gt;Scientists&amp;#8217; Photos Reveal Their Inner Mr. Spock&lt;/a&gt; which I found funny in a science-curious kind of way. I hadn&amp;#8217;t thought about the message you could be sending depending on which cheek you show. I had only noticed that people like to show more serious-looking photos of themselves and sometimes make it an obviously funny one. I have to say too that some of the pages from my co-workers don&amp;#8217;t even show a picture. I guess that&amp;#8217;s a more recent trend to make it more &amp;#8220;professional&amp;#8221; looking. Dunno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to guess that dead center-looking pictures are rare. At least when you look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psy.gla.ac.uk/staff/index.php?id=RJ002&#34;&gt;Rachael Jack&amp;#8217;s one&lt;/a&gt; it stands out. It reminds me of passport pictures. For my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~lcollado/index.html#.UD-xBmie5us&#34;&gt;new academic site&lt;/a&gt; I choose one that doesn&amp;#8217;t look serious, I wanted a fun one! Plus I make it obvious which country I&amp;#8217;m from ^^.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason this doesn&amp;#8217;t surprise me:&lt;/p&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;while English language and literature scholars showed the left cheek and engineers showed the right, psychologists were more difficult to categorize. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
